# CS 3310 Design & Analysis of Algorithms
This repository stores a few of my projects from my class CS 3310 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms
I took this course at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona

There are 2 Projects in this repository. 

- One project implements various algorithms to conduct matrix multiplication. Matrix Multiplication algorithms used were:
  -   Classical matrix
  -   Divide-and-conquer
  -   Strassen's
- The other project solves the Selection Problem to find the kth smallest element in a list. This is achieved in two ways:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort  

## Things I learned in this course
- Algorithms for fundamental problems.
- Efficiency analysis using asymptotic notation.
- Principal algorithm design techniques
- NP-theory
